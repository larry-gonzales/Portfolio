# Portfolio
A personal portfolio website to showcase my ongoing web development work.

This responsive site was created with pure HTML, CSS and JS, and is the first website that I've built and hosted.

A few of the challenges I ran into were on the responsive end of the CSS. As I researched certain trouble areas, I was able to rework some of the alignment issues. Then, after a dive into Grid and Flexbox, I later reworked a lot of the layout again. Most of my spacing and centering issues were solved with much less code and much better results.
